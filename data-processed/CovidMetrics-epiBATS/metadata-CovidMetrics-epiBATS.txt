  Forecasts are based on TBATS - models (DeLivera, Hyndman und Snyder (2011)) and are updated daily for each German state. Final models are based on comparing multiple models and selecting the best-performing model based on AIC in historical data.
  The models forecast the 7-day incidence. The forecasting model is the same that is used at our website below.
