data_inputs: RKI (reported cases, reported deaths)
team_model_designation: primary
methods: Deterministic SEIR type model
methods_long: This model is an extended SEIR model with additional compartments for the hospitalized, intensive unit, long-COVID, and death. The model is also developed as an age-structured model. The model is fitted to reported cases and reported cumulative deaths. The fitted parameters are used to predict the number of cases and deaths.
