methods_long: Our model accounts for uncertainty via a Bayesian framework, for time-dependence on past COVID-19 counts via an INGARCH structure and non-linearity via time-varying coefficients. In addition, time-lagged NPI covariates have been coded and incorporated into the Bayesian framework to assess whether policy measures can effectively reduce positive counts.
