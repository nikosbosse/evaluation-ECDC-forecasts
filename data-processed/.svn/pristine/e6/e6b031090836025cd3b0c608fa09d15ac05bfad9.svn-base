methods_long: This model uses the Gompertz function in combination with some kind of "clever parameter adjustment" to already existing data for a covid infection wave. The model focuses currently on infection cases, but could easily be extended to other data like hospitalization or death cases. Based on the initial period of a Covid wave, the model provides a prediction for the expected maximum in terms of highest value and point of time. This approach delivered already excellent results for Germany last March & April when many forcasts reported in German media were extrtemely far from later actual values.
