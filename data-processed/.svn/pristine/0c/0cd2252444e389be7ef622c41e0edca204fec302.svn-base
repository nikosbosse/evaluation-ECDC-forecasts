team_model_designation: secondary
methods: Forecasts of county level incidence based on regional reproduction numbers.
team_funding: ECDC
data_inputs: RKI, ECDC, Polish patient data, county level incidences by age group, distribution for time to death and proportion of deaths in each age group
methods_long: "Using county level incidence data we estimate regional reproduction numbers \
  \ with a small area estimation approach. These estimates are the basis for \
  \ simulations of future incidences which are then aggregated to the state or \
  \ national level. Deaths are predicted by age groups and use estimated case fatality \
  \ ratios."
