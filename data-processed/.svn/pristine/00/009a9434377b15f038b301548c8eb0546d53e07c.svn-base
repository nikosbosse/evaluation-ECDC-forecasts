methods: Extended Kalman filter based on reproduction equation
data_inputs: JHU
methods_long: "We use the reproduction equation to obtain a state space model whose states \
  \ comprise incidences, the current reproduction number, the generation time distribution, \
  \ as well as fraction of deaths by delay. An extended Kalman filter is used to fit this model \
  \ and obtain forecasts. Quantiles for the latter are obtained from a log-normal distribution \
  \ with mean and variance given by the prediction steps."
