team_model_designation: primary
methods: The Trend Model predicts daily cases and deaths using linear
  extrapolation on the linear or log scale of the underlying trend estimated
  by a robust LOESS seasonal-trend decomposition model.

methods_long: "Our forecasts are based on the reported numbers of cases and
  deaths at the country or regional level. Our modeling substantially relies on
  estimation of the underlying trend by a robust LOESS seasonal-trend
  decomposition model, which allows to account for non-stationary weekly
  seasonality, outliers, missing data and delayed reports. To further predict
  daily cases and deaths we use linear extrapolation of the estimated smooth
  trend either on the original or on the logarithmic scale."
