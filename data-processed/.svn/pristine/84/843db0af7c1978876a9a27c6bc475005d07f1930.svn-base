methods_long: "This model makes predictions about the future, unconditional on particular\
  \  intervention strategies. The model consists of two processes. The first process \
  \ is a statistical model of how the  number of COVID-19 infections changes over\
  \ time. The second process maps the number of  infections to the reported data.\
  \ We model the growth of new cases as the product of a  dynamic growth parameter and\
  \ the underlying numbers of susceptible and infected cases  in the population at\
  \ the previous time step, scaled by the size of the state's starting  susceptible\
  \ population. Change 2020-10-29: The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of\
  \ the virus in that state on that date and is a weighted regression between the\ 
  \ trend in the growth rate over the past 42 days and a growth rate that would keep \
  \ the number of new daily confirmed cases constant. The weights of these two components\
  \ are dynamically tuned to the observed data. To model new deaths in the population,\
  \ we assume that a fraction of the 1,2,3,4, or 5-week moving average of the daily \
  \ confirmed cases will die. The model learns both the moving average window and the\
  \ case fatality fraction that best fits the historical observations."
