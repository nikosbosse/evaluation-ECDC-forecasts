methods: A simple stochastic SEIR state space model
team_funding: no funding
data_inputs: John Hopkins data, Google Mobility Recors
methods_long: A variant of SeirFilter (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251834v1) with compartnents S-E-Ia-Ip-Is-R-D where Ia are the asymptomatic, Ip the presymptomatic and Is the symptomatic. Only past data and the Google mobility indices used as inputs, the variability of R0 (virus variant, vaccination, seasonality) is handled via its estimation from past. In particular, R0 is estimated by the weighted time-average of reproduction number  (computed as R(t)=(C(t) - C(t-7))/(C(t-5)-C(t-12))) divided by the estimated number of contacts (obtained from the Google mobilty indices).
